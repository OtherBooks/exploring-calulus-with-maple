\subsection*{Introduction:}
Arc length\index{arc length} is the distance between two points along a section of a curve. If this curve can be represented by a function $f(x)$, then we can calculate the length of this curve from $x=a$ to $x=b$ with the formula
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:arclength}
    L = \displaystyle\int_{a}^b \sqrt{1 + [f^{\prime}(x)]^2}\, dx.
\end{equation}

In this activity, we will determine the arc length of a variety of functions and curves. We can then apply equation \eqref{eq:arclength} above to determine the length of the cable that holds up the Golden Gate Bridge.

\subsection*{Exercises:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the function $y = \cos(\sin(x))$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Plot the graph of the function.
        \item Determine the arc length of this curve between the points $(0,1)$ and $(\pi,1)$.\index{Pi}
    \end{enumerate}
    \marginnote[-0.7cm]{Remember that you must type \texttt{Pi} in Maple for $\pi$.}
    \item Consider the curve $y^2 = x^3$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Plot the graph of the curve using \texttt{implicitplot()}.
            \index{packages!plots}
        \item Solve the equation of the curve for $y$ to get the equations of the top and bottom halves of the curves as functions.
        \item Determine the arc length of this curve between the points $(1,1)$ and $(4,8)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Consider the function $x = \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{y}\,(y-3)$.\marginnote[0.1cm]{Don't forget to include multiplication between $\sqrt{y}$ and $(y-3)$.}
   
    \begin{enumerate} \marginnote[0.2cm]{In this exercise, since $x$ is a function of $y$, equation \eqref{eq:arclength} should be an integral in terms of $y$.}
        \item Plot the graph of the function. Since $x$ is defined as a function of $y$, try plotting the equation of the curve using \texttt{implicitplot()}.
        \item Determine the arc length of this curve for $1 \leq y \leq 9$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The main span of the Golden Gate Bridge is $1280$ m long, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:goldengate}. The top of each of the towers is 230 m above the surface of the water. To find the length of the cables between these two towers, we will assume that a freely hanging cable between two towers takes the form of a \textbf{catenary}. 
    \marginnote[-2cm]{A catenary is a curve that an idealized hanging chain or cable assumes under its own weight when supported only at its ends. The Golden Gate Bridge cable is almost a catenary and almost a parabola, but not quite either (because of the weight of the cables, the suspender ropes, and the roadway).}

    \marginnote[0.5cm]{Functions like $\cosh()$ and $\sinh()$ are called hyperbolic functions. These functions are analogs of the ordinary trigonometric, or circular, functions; just as the points $(\cos(t), \sin(t))$ form a circle with a unit radius, the points $(\cosh(t), \sinh(t))$ form the right half of the equilateral hyperbola.}
        \index{mathematical functions!hyperbolic functions!sinh}
         \index{mathematical functions!hyperbolic functions!cosh}
    The general form for a catenary passing through its lowest point at $(0,k)$ is 
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:catenary}
        f(x) = a\left(\cosh\left(\tfrac{x}{a}\right)-1\right)+k,
    \end{equation}
    or equivalently,
    \[f(x) = a\left(\frac{{\rm e}^{x/a} + {\rm e}^{-x/a}}{2}-1\right)+k.\]

    Assume that the Golden Gate Bridge cable takes the shape of a catenary over the main span with its lowest point at $(0,70)$, corresponding to a height of $70$ m above the water.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Using equation \eqref{eq:catenary} and the points provided in Figure \ref{fig:goldengatesimple}, what is the value of $k$?
        \item Substitute the value of $k$ into \eqref{eq:catenary} and assign this function in Maple.
        \item Use the coordinates of the top of one of the towers from Figure \ref{fig:goldengatesimple}, as well as the \texttt{fsolve()} command to determine the value of $a$ for this catenary.
            \index{solving equations!fsolve}
        \item Using equation \eqref{eq:catenary} with the values of $a$ and $k$ that you have found, determine the length of one of the cables for the main span.
